\title{Amazon Web Services Request Signatures}
\description{
Generates Amazon Web Services (AWS) request signatures for RESTful APIs.
}
\details{
This package contains functions mostly intended for developers to use in building API client packages for Amazon Web Services APIs.

The main function of interest is \code{\link{signature_v4_auth}}, which wraps the other internal functions and returns a named list of elements to be used in authenticating an API request using AWS Signature Version 4. Another function, \code{\link{signature_v2_auth}} implements the older, mostly deprecated Version 2 algorithm.

Recent versions of the package (>= 0.2.8) identify credentials by walking through a tree of possible sources of values (described in \code{\link{locate_credentials}}), with optional verbosity, in a manner similar to the Python boto 3 library.

A lower-level function that may be of use to end users is \code{\link{use_credentials}}, which sets the environment variables used by this package based upon values specified in a \samp{.aws/credentials} file. That function is called by default during package load, if no environment variables are set.

To use this (and any cloudyr package) on AWS EC2 instances, users will also need to install the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=aws.ec2metadata}{aws.ec2metadata} package, which allows \code{\link{locate_credentials}} to know it is running in an instance and check for relevant values.
